## Running Local Development Server

Project has dependencies that require Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher. Using nvm is highly recommended.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
